Journey
=======

Journey is a dynamic flash video. Inspired by [Uniqlock](http://www.uniqlo.jp/uniqlock/) and public transit boredom, Journey is meant solely as something to stare at mindlessly when you have nothing better to do. At the very most, you might find it slightly amusing.

Journey juxtaposes music with short video clips, timing it so that no video clip bridges two songs. The intended effect is that each song combines with several clips to create a low-key music video of sorts, and that each music video is bookended by a short period of silence and darkness.

Songs and clips are selected randomly from a large pool of assets, so your experience should seldom be the same.

Where you can watch it
======================

Journey is WIP, and it is currently not hosted anywhere. However...

Proof of concept
================

The previous incarnation of Journey featured exactly the same mechanics, but was video-game-themed. Due to the amount of effort required to produce assets, it was abandoned--but not before a proof of concept was published, which you can see [here](http://bo.servebeer.com/transition).
