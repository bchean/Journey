Journey
=======

Journey is a dynamic flash video. Inspired by [Uniqlock](http://www.uniqlo.jp/uniqlock/) and public transit boredom, Journey is meant solely as something to stare at mindlessly when you have nothing better to do. Hopefully, you will find it at least slightly amusing.

Journey juxtaposes music with short video clips, timing it so that no video clip bridges two songs. The intended effect is that each song combines with several clips to create a low-key music video of sorts, and that each music video is bookended by a short period of silence and darkness.

Songs and clips are selected randomly from a large pool of assets, so your experience should rarely be the same.

Where you can watch it
======================

Journey is WIP, and it is currently not hosted anywhere.

Proof of concept
================

A previous incarnation of Journey featured same mechanics, but was video-game-themed. Due to the amount of effort required to produce assets, it was abandoned, but not before a proof of concept was published. You can watch it [here](http://bo.servebeer.com/transition). (Try hitting spacebar.)
